SFML CEGUI Test
===============

This is a simple program to test how SFML works together with
CEGUI. Its code serves as a usage example; the only source file
src/main.cpp contains the minimal code required to make things run.

Requirements
------------

- SFML 2.3 or higher
- CEGUI 0.8.5 or higher (currently you need to compile CEGUI from the Mercurial repository for that, see below)

How to build
------------

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/where/you/installed/cegui-0.8.5 ..
    $ make
    $ ./ceguitest

Note there is no install step needed. What do you want to do with that
program in /usr anyway? The program looks for its data in the
directory "../data", so be sure to have the working directory set up
accordingly.

How to compile CEGUI from Mercurial (and why)
---------------------------------------------

CEGUI < 0.8.5 has a fatal bug on Linux if used with the OpenGL
renderer and a recent version of glm that causes it to render
everything upside down and minified:

  https://bitbucket.org/cegui/cegui/issues/1063/openglrenderer-on-linux-renders-cegui

The problem occurs on ArchLinux (glm 0.9.7.1). If you have an older
version of glm on your system, and get this program to work with a
version of CEGUI older than 0.8.5 **please report that to me**
(<quintus@quintilianus.eu>).

To circumvent the bug, you must use a version of CEGUI that has this
bug fixed. The next stable version of CEGUI, 0.8.5, will have that
bugfix included, but as of January 2016 0.8.5 is the development
version of CEGUI and has not yet been released. Therefore you have to
compile it from the Mercurial repository.

First ensure you have CEGUI dependencies installed; especially take
care to install glm, glfw (glfw2 and glfw3 should both work fine; I
used glfw3), all with development headers. Then clone the repository
and switch to the v0-8 branch:

    $ hg clone hg clone https://bitbucket.org/cegui/cegui
    $ cd cegui
    $ hg update v0-8

Compile CEGUI like this:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/cegui-0.8.5-dev \
      -DCEGUI_BUILD_PYTHON_MODULES=OFF \
      -DCEGUI_BUILD_RENDERER_OPENGL=ON ..
    $ make
    # make install

This will compile CEGUI with the OpenGL renderer enabled and python
modules disabled (ArchLinux ships Python 3 by default, which breaks
CEGUI’s compilation process as it expects "python" to be Python 2).
CEGUI will be installed into /opt/cegui-0.8.5-dev, which is the
path you have to hand to -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH as described further
above already.
